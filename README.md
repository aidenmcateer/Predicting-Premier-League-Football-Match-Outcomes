# Predicting-Premier-League-Football-Match-Outcomes
Using statistical analysis and machine learning models to predict football match outcomes in the Premier League

For this data science project, i have sourced data from football-data.co.uk

Following completing analysis, comparing categorical columns to FTR and numerical columns to FTR I created a "form rating" 

Using the strongest correlating columns, I then went onto create a Machine Learning Model with the dataset, which had a 62% accuracy
